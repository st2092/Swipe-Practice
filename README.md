# Swipe-Practice
Android App to practice with determining Swipe events.

__How it works__

  Since Android does not have very good support for swipes, it is up to the developer to determine what is a swipe and not. In this exercise I have the application keep track of the user's finger movement. When their finger movement pass a certain threshold it is consider a swipe. Depending on the direction of the swipe (up, down, left, or right) the application reacts accordingly. In the case of this exercise, for each unique swipe the app gives a toast message indicating the direction of the swipe.
